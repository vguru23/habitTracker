# habitTracker
Web application to track progress on the 30-Day Hard Challenge (similar to 75 Days Hard Challenge) except the challenge is for 30 days and tracks the following habits:
  - workout
  - water intake
  - learning new vocab word
  - meditation
  - journal
  - reading a nonfiction book
This application allows users to input information about each day and save information. Users can track the intensity of the workout, if the water goal was met, meditation experience, new vocab word, a synonym, journal entry (journal prompt can also be given if the user clicks the prompt needed), current book title, and takeaways from that day's reading.

Currently, I have built this website using HTML, CSS, and JS. In the next week, I hope to use Node.js and MongoDB to store the entries in a database and query the database to display the information rather than storing it in local storage as I'm doing right now. Afterward, I also want to build a user profile functionality and add authentication.
